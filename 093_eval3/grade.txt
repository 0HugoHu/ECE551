Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4
g++ -o cyoa-step1 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -std=gnu++98 cyoa-step1.cpp Page.cpp Tool.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /test/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Cannot open the file!
timeout: the monitored command dumped core
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /test/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Cannot open the file!

1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /test/story3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
