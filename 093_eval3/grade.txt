Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f  
make: 'cyoa-step1' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1
------------------------------------
