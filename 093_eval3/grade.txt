Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4
g++ -o cyoa-step1 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -std=gnu++98 cyoa-step1.cpp Page.cpp Tool.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 test/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
We considered this a failure case.
But you did not (exit status was EXIT_SUCCESS).


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 test/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 test/story3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Errors in story.txt4!
timeout: the monitored command dumped core
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 test/story4 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
We considered this a failure case.
But you did not (exit status was EXIT_SUCCESS).


1.5: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 test/story5 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
We considered this a failure case.
But you did not (exit status was EXIT_SUCCESS).
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1
------------------------------------

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
