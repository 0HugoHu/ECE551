Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f  
make: 'cyoa-step1' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1/ < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2/ < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /home/yh342/ece551/093_eval3/story1/test5 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Cannot open the file!
timeout: the monitored command dumped core
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /home/yh342/ece551/093_eval3/ < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Cannot open the file!
timeout: the monitored command dumped core
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f  
make: 'cyoa-step2' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
rm -f  
The code did not compile!

Overall Grade: NO GRADE YET
