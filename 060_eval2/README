This is your second *evaluative* assignment. That means that we want you to
show us what you know/what you can do (as opposed to most assignments,
which are to practice and learn from).

Accordingly, you may not work with anyone else on this assignment. All work
must be your own.

To proceed, run

honor-statement 060_eval2

which will present you with the rules for this assignment, ask you
questions to make sure you understand, and ask you to sign the honor
statement. 

Once you have done that, your directory will be refreshed with the actual
assignment. 

====================
Late policy reminder:
====================
As a reminder, our late policy for evalautive assignments is that you may
submit (or resubmit) up to 1 week after we return grades for a maximum of
70% assignment.   We strongly encourage you to submit a well-done assignment
by the deadline to receive more than 70%, however, if you find that you are
unable to complete the assignment in time, or receive a very low grade,
please remember that you may resubmit for up to 70%.
