Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2 story-step3 story-step4 story-step1.o story-step2.o story-step3.o story-step4.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Your file matched the expected output
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
